# 5922 Neural Nets Project

## Introduction

### Project Goal/Problem definition
-	This project will be focus on how to use neural networds to analyze the tweets about prochoice VS prolife due to the Roe vs. Wade cancellation sentence. 
-	The dataset gathers from Twitter and analyze the influence operations
-	The goal of this project is to filter out the dataset and provide a general view of Roe vs. Wade case, probably involving sentiment analysis. 
- Data visualization will be created to present for people who want to quickly understand the whole case

### Dataset description
-	The dataset is originally from Twitter but there is already available dataset from Kaggle. The dataset has 56,040 Tweets 
-	The dataset has id, retweet_count, reply_count, like_count, text columns. 

### Proposed Methodology
-	I plan to clean up the tweets and find the pattern of tweets based on the timeline of the event, provide a lot of time-series data visualization to help audience to know the general view
-	There will be a lot of misinformation bots in the Tweets, hopefully can identify them and filter them out
-	The word cloud will not be the only way to show the text features, try different plots to show text findings

### Five questions that I want to try to answer:
- How is people reaction changed between jury date?
- How is the opinion related to location? 
- What is the sentiment for people after each jury date?
- What is the frequency of tweets during the whole time line?
- What are the words that contribute positive/negative to sentiment?
